(Picket) Framework
==================
Why did I create this Project?

I´m a Freelance Software Consultant based in Munich, Germany.
Normally I do Java Projects, mainly with Apache Wicket and Spring.

The Problem is, my domain hoster only provides me with PHP:(.

**I didn´t want to miss the joy of working with wicket to create my own page, so**
**the only solution was to implement wicket in PHP and call it (picket).**

***

Currently the Project is in Pre-Alpha State, but already productive, since my complete Business Homepage for [Effective Trainings](http://www.effectivetrainings.de) is done with Picket.

You can find some examples in the Examples Section on [Picket Examples](http://www.effectivetrainings.de/framework/examples/pages/ExamplesPage.php)

Enjoy!
